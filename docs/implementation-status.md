# Implementation status

**English** | [日本語](implementation-status.ja.md) | [Home](../README.md)

## Current assessment — 2026-11-10

**Provisional initial-version completion: 30–35%. The former 50% estimate is withdrawn.**
100% means capture → adoption → retrieval → Light/Deep → comparison evaluation →
one existing-agent integration. REM, diary and wider rollout are excluded.
File/test counts and prepared interfaces do not increase this estimate.
This page and its Japanese translation are the ONLY current status authority;
dated gate reports are historical evidence.

## Verified merged baseline

[PR #23](https://github.com/moruku36/agent-sleep-lab/pull/23) is **MERGED** at
`025e32314efd246dd5b04b3476fa5b2865287a3c`; source
`087f2a3da8e4188a70a7a84d50d1a8d4eb14e1dc`.
The owner merged it on 2026-11-10. Read-only GitHub queries verified the merge
and successful [main CI](https://github.com/moruku36/agent-sleep-lab/actions/runs/42798899032).
[PR CI](https://github.com/moruku36/agent-sleep-lab/actions/runs/42796639749)
passed all 241 unique cases on each of Python 3.11 and 3.13 (482 case
executions / two matrix invocations), 339 relative file links and wheel build.
No paid API calls occur in CI.

Merged foundation: synthetic evidence/provenance, policy and receipt libraries,
transactional adoption, scoped retrieval, rollback/logical forgetting; body-bound
v2 Light/Deep proposals and generated candidate claims; explicit runtime CLI;
MiMo adapter, durable checkpoints, identical A/B rejection, diagnostic
non-comparability, manual handoff and stopped-worker recovery.
Generated candidates are not independently verified or adopted automatically.
This is not production authentication, physical purge or a deployed agent connection.

## Current development branch

`feat/offline-agent-memory-bridge`, based on the PR #23 merge above.

- Added an opt-in [OSS Contributor collect-only bridge](oss-bridge.md) for the
  existing agent's `TriageDecision` dictionary contract.
- Capture preserves decisions and any model rationale as untrusted observations,
  not verified issue facts. It creates no memory, verifier/evaluator receipt or
  adoption. Pending and failure states stay observations.
- Read-only context uses current-policy adopted-memory retrieval with fixed scope,
  byte limits and exclusions. No target ledger, scoring, configuration, scheduler,
  patch/PR path or production host is changed.
- This is **synthetic offline wiring**, not real-data ingestion or proof of
  delivery/use by the existing agent. Real operational capture needs a separate
  non-synthetic retention/authorization contract; do not relabel real logs.

## Current branch verification

- **247 unique cases / one full invocation, all passed, 12.183 s**, using the
  existing Python 3.13 wheel-verification environment with project dependency pins.
  This includes six new bridge cases. No environment was created or modified.
- Earlier repair checks: system Python lacked jsonschema and executed zero test
  bodies; existing general dev environment ran six bridge cases with one test
  error (wrong receipt-table name). Corrected the test and the full run passed.
  Total this branch: 253 case executions / two body-running invocations, plus one
  load-only failure. No hidden re-runs or changed test budget.
- New branch CI has not been run; merged-baseline CI above is not its verification.
- Documentation: **349 relative file links / 74 Markdown files passed**;
  anchors and remote URLs are not checked.
- Actual five-task A/B and live-model performance improvement remain unverified.

## Genuine remaining work

1. Resolve the MiMo execution approval/binding failure and obtain a real
   provider/model receipt. The owner approved the saved review command, but the
   unchanged native `ask=always` submission was again denied before execution:
   approval could not safely bind. No alternate route or model was attempted.
   An earlier design request timed out without receipt; its usage/cost is unknown.
2. Run the prepared five-task real-response comparison with applicable caller
   budget, independently accepted experience memories and a frozen evaluator.
   [Fictional development tasks](../examples/paper-pilot/README.md) are preparation,
   not an independent holdout. Exact-match fixture scoring is not scientific
   paper-quality proof.
3. Connect ONE existing agent and verify actual capture/retrieval use. Offline
   bridge contracts and manual handoff drafts are preparation only. Real-data
   boundaries and delivery/use logging remain open.
4. Relevant raw ranking, physical purge and broader production fault acceptance
   remain open; none is established by passing offline tests.

Runtime contracts and commands: [English](runtime-guide.md) / [日本語](runtime-guide.ja.md).
The MiMo CLI lacks per-call max-token control: post-generation byte rejection
is NOT a hard token or monetary limit; unknown outcomes may have incurred cost.
